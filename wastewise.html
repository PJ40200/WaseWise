            <h3>Life is a Waste</h3>
            <p>Today we live in a world of waste ! Yes that's true India annually needs land equivalent to 
                ten times the area of Rashtrapati Bhawan estate to dump waste that urban areas generate.Open and
                unsanitary landfills contribute to contamination of drinking water and can cause infection and 
                transmit diseases. The dispersal of debris pollutes ecosystems and dangerous substances from 
                electronic waste or industrial garbage puts a strain on the health of urban dwellers and the 
                environment

                <p><b>Recycling is the process of collecting and processing materials that would otherwise be thrown away as trash, turning them into new products. Instead of disposing of items like paper, plastic, glass, and metal in landfills or incinerators, recycling allows these materials to be used again to create new products.<br/>
                These stuff can be recycled Paper Products: Newspapers,Magazines, Office paper, Junk mail, Cardboard boxes (broken down flat)
                Plastic Containers: Plastic bottles (water bottles, soda bottles), Plastic jugs (milk jugs, detergent bottles), Plastic containers (yogurt cups, margarine tubs), Plastic lids and caps (if accepted, often they need to be removed and recycled separately)
                Glass: Glass bottles, Glass jars (jam jars, sauce jars)
                Metal: Aluminum cans (soda cans, beer cans), Steel cans (soup cans, vegetable cans), Tin cans
                Cardboard: Shipping boxes, Cereal boxes, Food boxes (frozen food boxes), Cartons: Milk cartons, Juice boxes
                Electronics (often through specialized programs): Cell phones, Computers, Batteries, Printers

            <h1>Composting</h1>
            <h2>1. What is Composting?</h2>
            <p>Composting is a natural process where organic materials decompose into a nutrient-rich soil conditioner. It's a way of recycling organic waste like food scraps, yard trimmings, and paper into a valuable resource for gardening and agriculture.</p>
        
            <h2>2. Compostable Items</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Green Materials: Examples include fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, grass clippings, and plant trimmings.</li>
                <li>Brown Materials: Examples include leaves, straw, wood chips, and newspaper.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>3. Items to Avoid</h2>
            <p>Avoid composting meat, dairy, oils, pet waste, and diseased plants. Special considerations should be made for items like eggshells, cardboard, and tea bags.</p>
        
            <h2>4. Breakdown of Composting Process</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Organic Materials: Start with a mix of "green" materials (like fruit and vegetable scraps, grass clippings) and "brown" materials (such as leaves, straw, paper). The green provides nitrogen, while the brown adds carbon.</li>
                <li>Microorganisms: Bacteria, fungi, worms, and other tiny organisms break down the organic matter. They need air, water, and the right balance of green and brown materials to thrive.</li>
                <li>Decomposition: Over time, these microorganisms break down the organic materials into a dark, crumbly substance called humus. This humus is rich in nutrients and beneficial for plants.</li>
                <li>Finished Compost: When the composting process is complete, you're left with nutrient-rich compost that can be added to soil to improve its structure, fertility, and ability to retain moisture.</li>

                    Special Considerations: Details on composting items like eggshells, cardboard, and tea bags.
                    
                    4.) Breakdown of composting process
                    1 - Organic Materials: You start with a mix of "green" materials (like fruit and vegetable scraps, grass clippings) and "brown" materials (such as leaves, straw, paper). The green provides nitrogen, while the brown adds carbon.
                    
                    2 - Microorganisms: Bacteria, fungi, worms, and other tiny organisms break down the organic matter. They need air, water, and the right balance of green and brown materials to thrive.
                    
                    3 - Decomposition: Over time, these microorganisms break down the organic materials into a dark, crumbly substance called humus. This humus is rich in nutrients and beneficial for plants.
                    
                    4 - Finished Compost: When the composting process is complete, you're left with nutrient-rich compost that can be added to soil to improve its structure, fertility, and ability to retain moisture.</p>
